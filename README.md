- Implementation of correlation rules for pattern and anomaly identification.

### Extended Detection and Response (XDR)

- Comprehensive threat detection using advanced analytics and threat intelligence.

### Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

- Streamlined incident response through automated workflows and playbooks.

### Additional Components

- **File Integrity Monitoring:**
  - Continuous monitoring of file systems to detect unauthorized changes.

- **Malware Analysis:**
  - Analysis of suspicious files and behaviors to identify and mitigate malware threats.

- **Threat Intelligence:**
  - Integration of threat intelligence feeds to enhance proactive threat detection.

- **Compliance Auditing:**
  - Regular auditing to ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards.

- **Network Security:**
  - Implementation of measures to secure network infrastructure and data transmission.

- **System Configuration:**
  - Regular assessment and secure configuration of systems to prevent vulnerabilities.

- **Intrusion Detection:**
  - Continuous monitoring for signs of unauthorized access or malicious activities.

## Data Privacy and Compliance

This project adheres to key data privacy principles, ensuring accountability, transparency, and compliance with GDPR regulations.

### Compliance Framework
